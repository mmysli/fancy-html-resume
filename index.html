    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      A husband to a wife, a father of one. A traveller, sailor, hiker, mountain
      climber, diver, and a surfer (a bad one). And more.. or less - time and
      conditions dependent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also a MD, taking care of kidneys. Or trying to. Used to climg on trees as
      a kid - that was more fun. Forever catching up to finish my PhD. I will be
      a free soul afterwards. Finally.
